**** UNDER DEVELOPMENT ****

An automated pipeline for 4C-seq experimental design, with or without genetic variants of interest

### There are three possible input modes:
1) __Basic__ (classic 4C-seq)
2) __Allele-specific__ (4C-seq for a specific allele of a single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] of interest)
3) __Allele-aware__ (4C-seq resulting in separable sequencing results for a SNP of interest in a heterozygous sample)

### Requirements:
- perl
-
